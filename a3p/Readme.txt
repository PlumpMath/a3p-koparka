RUNNING A3P FROM SOURCE

1. Download and install Panda3D: http://panda3d.org
   Currently, A3P requires at least version 1.7.0.
   Make sure you install Panda3D *within* the A3P source folder, to
   make things easier. If you know what you're doing, install it wherever
   you want.

2. Add the Panda3D Python directory to your system path. Then open a command
   prompt and navigate to the A3P source folder. If you have other Python
   installations, you may have to erase the PYTHONPATH environment variable.
   
3. Run this command:
   python main.py

4. To see more command line arguments, run this command:
